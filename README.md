## Download and installation
  To download unreal engine 4 and run our project in the editor, go to https://www.unrealengine.com/ and click "Get Unreal" in the upper right hand corner.
  Once Unreal is downloaded you must create an account with epic games and login. Once logged into the epic games launcher, download the unreal engine 4.7.* and launch it. Browse your computer files and find the project folder and open it.
  This is all you need to do to launch Ascension in the unreal engine 4 editor.
